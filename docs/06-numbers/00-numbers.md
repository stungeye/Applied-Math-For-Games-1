# Numbers

Numbers are the basis for all of mathematics. In this module, we'll explore how mathematicians group different types of numbers into separate categories. We'll do a deep dive into the mathematics of 2D Euclidean Vector. This will be followed by a review of how numbers are represented in different numeral systems. Lastly, we investigate how whole and real numbers are stored in binary by computers.

## Objectives

Upon completion of this module, you should be able to:

- Describe the various categories of numbers used by mathematicians.
- Describe the concept of a Euclidean Vector.
- Perform mathematical calculation using 2D vectors.
- Describe how numbers are represented in place-value numeral systems.
- Define decimal, binary, hexadecimal numeral systems.
- Convert between these numeral systems.
- Count using the binary and hexadecimal systems.
- Explain how computers represent real numbers.
- Convert real numbers to the binary IEEE 754 format.
